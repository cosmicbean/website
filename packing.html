              <h2>How to pack for a trip</h2>
              <p><time datetime="2025-04-08">April 8, 2025</time></p>

              <p>
                On February 20th of 2025, I left New York City to travel indefinitely.  I hope it will assuage my more metropolitan friend that "indefinitely" means that the end-point is undefined, not that I will be out of the city forever.
              </p>

              <h3>Why I pack so light</h3>
              <p>
                My initial obsession with packing light germinated in my neuroticism surrounding money, more specifically, my aversion to baggage fees.  When flying to Pittsburgh from New York on a $70 Spirit flight, it feels icky to pay over the cost of the flight on baggage.  Equipped with items deemed “personal”, I’ve gone across the country, but I have yet to cross an international border without a proper carry-on item.
                <br>
                Though I can’t pretend that the relatively minor amortized cost of a couple baggage fees across a several-month South American journey still bothered me, the primary deterrent of bringing a large carry-on was the lack of mobility and its relatively minor trade-off of convenience.
                <br>
                Con of carry-on: Mobility.  My plan being South America for ~3 months, I didn’t want to miss out on any experience because I had belongings holding me back.  I hated that I stayed in my lovely but expensive Noho apartment for an extra year because I was tied down by my piano.
                <br>
                Pros of carry-on: Laundry.  Perhaps for other people, there are some other pros that don’t affect me, like being able to carry a nice camera, medical equipment, cooking implements, physical books, or other things that don’t occur to me.  However, I’m no photographer, I have no extenuating medical conditions, I’m not good enough at cooking to necessitate specialized equipments, and I don’t mind an e-reader.  Beyond a laptop with chargers and a small dopp kit, the only things I needed to pack were clothes and miscellaneous non-essentials (which I’ll enumerate later).  Seeing as I’m only wearing one of each article of clothing at a time, it felt silly to pack for any more than 5x redundancy.  If you’re traveling for 7 days, it doesn’t make sense to pack for 5 days of clothes.  However, since I’m traveling indefinitely, laundry must be done no matter how many clothes are packed.
                <br>
                For most trips I take, I use only a personal item.  While I wanted to do this for my multi-month journey, many discouraged me, even those who themselves had gone on similar journeys.  I had done trips over a week with just a personal item, but I wondered if I was missing something that would prevent me from doing this.  I was inspired by <a href="https://reddit.com/r/onebag/">/r/onebag</a> and a blogger <a href="https://jeremymaluf.com/onebag/">Jeremy Maluf</a>.  I also thought this would be a good exercise in how little I could live with.  Of course, I mostly stay in hostels where there are chairs, cups, beds, sheets, and other basic things that negate the statement “my only belongings are those which fit in this single bag”.  Unsure of the implications of this though.

              </p>

              <h3>What I packed</h3>
              <p>
                I used a Fjallraven Kanken backpack.  I acquired this in high school, I’d like to think before they got cool, but maybe they just hadn’t arrived in unstylish western pennsylvania quite yet.  It has a capacity of just 16 liters, a mere 62% of the capacity of a standard JanSport backpack.

              <h3>Items offloaded after Patagonia</h3>
              <p>
                After coming to Buenos Aires after hiking Patagonia, I found some things unnecessary, and thankfully, I had a couple friends from NYC who stopped in town, and I was able to hand off some stuff for return and safekeeping back in the city:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Outdoor jacket</li>
                <li>Alto Recorder</li>
                <li>Letters from friends (given a day before departure)</li>
                <li>$100 bill (torn, exchange places wouldn’t accept it)</li>
                <li>Fjallraven waterproofing wax</li>
                <li>(ironic) college T-shirt</li>
                <li>Propeller hat</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Items to offload before Peru</h3>
              <p>
                There are still a couple things I have that I don't need or want that I'd like to offload as soon as possible:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Thick hiking pants</li>
                <li>Tin whistle</li>
                <li>Laptop (maybe keep)</li>
                <li>Sweater (undecided)</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                In late May or early June, I plan to return to the US for a few weeks to see friends and recalibrate.  After, I’m considering going to Europe for a few months.  I’ve been fantasizing about bringing yet fewer things.  The majority of both volume and weight come from clothing.  Often times, if my schedule is too tight to head to a laundry place, I wash clothes in my dry bag at my lodging.  So, in theory, I should be able to have two sets of clothes.  I wear one during the day, and I come home to wash it at night (5 minutes), it dries overnight, and even if it’s wet in the morning, I can still wear my other clothes I washed the night before.  I believe that I could condense my belongings to under 6 liters if I only had the absolute necessities.
              </p>
              <p>
                My hope in writing this is that you, too, can travel with just a personal item, and perhaps even less.  While I’m not generally against excess, I think most people could have a better time traveling if they figured out how to do so with less.  Much of the friction of travel comes from carrying stuff around, so it becomes much easier (and cheaper) with less.

Now that I go to Peru, there are still a couple things I’d like to offload:Thick hiking pants
